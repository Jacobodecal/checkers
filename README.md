--Checkers game made using pygame--

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Click on a piece that you want to move.
- Click on a valide house that you want to move the piece you clicked.
- Have fun!!

NEXT STEPS TO FINISH PROJECT:
- Implement alternate plays.
- Implement end_game function to check winner and loser.
- Implement king piece.
- Solve bugs of the game.

BUGS I SEEN YET:
- Near the corners there are some bugs to eat pieces (check the function that validates moves).
- Sometime, in a eat movement, 2 pieces are deleted.
